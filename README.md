### Looking for Pretzel.Linux v1.0.1?
I was too lazy to make a website, so just take it from here... https://www.mediafire.com/file/1my9f80wfqzdpwp/pretzel-linux-1.0.0.AppImage/file  
also pretzel.linux is not affiliated with pretzel or pretzel.rocks in any way shape or form please do not sue me

### Looking for Chess Desktop?
same excuses as above  
not affiliated with chess.com or chess company
